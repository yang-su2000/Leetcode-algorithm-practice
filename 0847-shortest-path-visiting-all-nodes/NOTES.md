- never seen this approach to do graph-dp
- essentially, when **unlimited visit time** happens
- key 1: need a **manual memo** to avoid recursion
- key 2: need a â€œknapsack-like" state update to encode both future visited and future **unvisited**
- or just floyd-warshell then do the normal graph-dp (recommended)
